# ML-for-Perception-Project
My final project of the course 896974, which engages with Super-Resolution.

Running: the entire project is included in the Colab notebook. It contains code in both Python and Bash, in order to perform the required operations.
So just run the Colab cells. All the related packages and the extra commands are included.
